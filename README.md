# The-Number-Game

This is a game of guessing your opponents number before you run out of rounds using Python, socketsIO, and flask.

**How to start**
1. **Start the server:** Run the 'server.py' script.
2. **Connect clients:** Click on the link to the server.
3. **Play the game:** Enter the queue and when matched Players take turns choosing a number for the opponent to try and guess from 1 to 10. The player to guess the opponents number first win or the opponent wins if the player runs out of rounds.

**Technologies used**
* Python
* Sockets
* flask
* socketIo

### Project Statement of Work (SOW)
**Project Title:** The Number Game
**Team:** Tristan Truxal
**Project Objective:** The goal of this project is to develop a simple turn-based number guessing game where two players compete to guess each other's chosen number. The functionality I am aiming to achieve is a effective interaction between two players, while also effectivly using multiplayer capabilities and error handling.

**Scope:**
* Inclusion:
  1. Server and client software to manage game states and user inputs.
  2. ClI interfaces for both server and client to facilitate game setup and play.
  3. Networking capability to handle simultaneous games in isolated sessions

* Exclusions:
  1. Graphical user interface (GUI)
  2. Tournaments
  3. Advanced statstics or player profiles
 
**Deliverables:**
1. Fully functional server script in Python
2. Client side using html and javascript for players to connect and play the game
3. documentation including setup instructions, game rules, and troubleshooting.
4. basic unit tets to ensure functionality of the components.

**Timeline:**
* Key Milestones:
  1. Setting up server-client connectivity with test (3 days)
  2. Implement game logic along with implementing test (5 days)
  3. Error handling and edge case testing ( 3 days)
  4. Finish documentation and testing ( 3 days)
 
* Task Breakdown:
  1. Setting up enviornment (4 hours)
  2. Design Server and Client interaction protocol (8 hours)
  3. Implement Server Logic ( 12 hours)
  4. Implement Client Logic ( 10 hours)
  5. Unit Testing and Debugging ( 16 hours)
  6. Documentation ( 6 hours)
  7. Final Integration and Testing (8 hours)

**Technical Requirements:**
* Hardware:
    1. Server capable of running Python and handling multiple client connections.
    2. Client devices (laptop or computer) with network access
 
* Software:
  1. Programming Language: Python 3.8 or Higher.
  2. Libraries: Socket for networking, Threading to manage client sessions, and Argparse for command line arguments, Selectors for multiple connections, Along with threading for effective message sending.
  3. Development Tools: Git for version control, and VS Code as IDE

**Assumptions:**
  1. Stable network connectivity between clients and the server.
  2. Clients have basic technical knowledge to operate a command line interface.
  3. Python and necessary libraries are installed on both server and client machines

**Roles and Responsibilities:**
1. Project Manager: Tristan Truxal
2. Developers: Tristan Truxal
3. Testers: Tristan Truxal

**Communication Plan**
1. Email

**Message Protocol**
1. The program uses Json in order to serialize and deseralize the messages being passed

**Game State Synchronization**
1. The server script acts as the central authority for managing game state, including player turns, guesses, and game progress.
2. The server uses socket.emit() to send game status and game state updates to all connected clients.
3. When a player disconnects, the handle_disconnect function is triggered, which removes the player from the queue or active game and informs the remaining player.

**Client-side Game Rendering**
1. On the client side, the JavaScript code listens for events like game_status and paired, which update the DOM elements to reflect the current game state.
2. By updating elements guessInput, submitGuessButton, and game-status based on events from the server, all clients maintain a synchronized view of the game state.

**Turn-Based Gameplay**
1. The server tracks which playerâ€™s turn it is through the game_state dictionary. The set_number and guess_number events ensure only the current player can set or guess numbers
2. The server broadcasts turn updates to all clients, so both players know whose turn it is.
3. The player positions is based on who is in the queue first and second.
 
**Player Identification**
1. Each player has a unique client_id based on request.sid, which the server uses to manage their state.
2. Players enter a username on connection, which the server stores and uses for identification during gameplay.

**Chat Functionality**
1. The sendChatMessage function on the client side sends a message through socket.emit, which the server then broadcasts to all clients.

### Playing The Game
1. Start the server using "python server.py"
2. Connect 2 clients clicking on the link for the server
3. Communicate with each other using the chat bar
4. To start the game you must enter the queue and wait for another person to join
5. After entering a game one person is selected as the setter and guesser
6. To win either the guesser enters the right number or the setter wins if they last 5 rounds.
